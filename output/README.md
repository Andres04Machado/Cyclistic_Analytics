## Output folder
### Author: Andres Machado

This folder contains all of the output that was rendered by the `Cyclistic_Capstone.Rmd` file found in the `code` folder of this repository. The output consisted of a `.html` file of the same name. I then took that file and made a `.pdf`
out of it to make it presentable in GitHub. 

Additionally, I created a separate folder within this folder called `plots` which houses the three bar plots that I created in the `.Rmd` file. The same bar plots can be found in the `.pdf` file but I figured they would be nice to have 
individually as well.
