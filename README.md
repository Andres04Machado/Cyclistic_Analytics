# Cyclistic_Analytics
This repository houses the case study I completed at the end of the Google Data Analytics Certificate. 

Cyclistic wants to increase annual memberships, which are more profitable than casual passes. To do this, the marketing team needs to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently. This insight will support a strategy to convert casual riders into annual members through targeted marketing campaigns.
