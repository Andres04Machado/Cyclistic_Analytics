## Code Folder                           
### Author: Andres Machado

This folder contains the `.Rmd` file which houses all of the code and markdown regarding this project. As this file was made approximately 2.5 years ago (as of May 2025), I took the liberty of cleaning it up from its typos and formatting.
`.Rmd` files are very similar to Jupyter Notebook files in the sense that you can run code and insert markdown all in the same file. This makes writing a report for importing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data very simple.

So, the file you are looking for is `Cyclistic_Capstone_Project.Rmd`. In the `output` folder, you will see the `html` output of this file and a `pdf` file to showcase it in a more presentable manner. To use this code, unfortunately you
need the `.csv` files of data to construct the dataset. I cannot provide the datasets because of the [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). I ran this code using RStudio and all the data handling details are in the file.

If you prefer to view code as an R script, you may access it through the file called `Cyclistic_Capstone_Project.R`.
